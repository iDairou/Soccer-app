# Project: Ekstraklasa Data Visualization from Sportradar API

**Description:**

This project is an interactive web application that fetches data from the Sportradar API concerning the Polish Ekstraklasa (top-tier football league). The application allows users to browse detailed information about matches from the last three seasons, with the ability to select a specific season.

**Features:**

*   **Season Selection:** Users can choose the Ekstraklasa season from which they want to display data.
*   **Loaders:** While data is being retrieved from the API, loaders (loading animations) are displayed, informing the user that the data is being processed. This provides a better user experience and prevents the impression that the application has frozen.
*   **Match Results Table:** Match results are presented in a clear and readable table.
*   **Adjustable Rows per Page:** Users can customize the number of matches displayed on a single page of the table.
*   **Dynamic Pagination:** The results table features dynamic pagination, allowing easy browsing of results from multiple matchdays.
*   **Match Details:** Upon selecting a specific match, the user is presented with a detailed timeline of the match, containing key events such as goals, player substitutions, cards, etc.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   Addition of team and individual player statistics.
*   Expansion of data scope to include other football leagues.
*   Implementation of a match search function.
*   Improvements to the user interface.

## Installation and configuration üíæ

The project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), follow the steps below to be able to use the application.

- Install all npm packages using command:
````
npm i
````

- To start develope mode use command:

````
npm start
````
- To access the api you must put the key in the file below with following structure
- temporary key: gbtPlIEHLjRb8iCAyOrav5wa9ldT5qfWCGyIZUcs
````
src\API\api_key.js

export const API_KEY = gbtPlIEHLjRb8iCAyOrav5wa9ldT5qfWCGyIZUcs;

````

## CORS requests solution
API is not intended to be called from a client application. To avoid it it's enough to install plugin to your browser which allows you to send cross-domain requests. For chrome it would be Moesif Origin & CORS Changer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc).
After installing this plugin just set your plugin ON (on your icon at the top), reload the page and everything should work fine.
