## Installation and configuration üíæ

The project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), follow the steps below to be able to use the application.

- Install all npm packages using command:
````
npm i
````

- To start develope mode use command:

````
npm start
````
- To access the api you must put the key in the file below with following structure
- temporary key: e49z2ru2g8huc43xke7qe6p9
````

export const API_KEY = e49z2ru2g8huc43xke7qe6p9;

## CORS requests solution
API is not intended to be called from a client application. To avoid it it's enough to install plugin to your browser which allows you to send cross-domain requests. For chrome it would be Moesif Origin & CORS Changer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc).
After installing this plugin just set your plugin ON (on your icon at the top), reload the page and everything should work fine.
